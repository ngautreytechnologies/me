    A small selection of systems projects that reflect the kind of architecture I care about most: integrity, clear
    boundaries, and software that remains reliable and maintainable as it evolves over time.

      <h3>CaseCell</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      CaseCell is a local-first evidence and chain-of-custody platform built for high-stakes workflows, where
      provenance, auditability, and operational correctness are non-negotiable.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is designed to produce artefacts that are traceable by construction, with strict separation between trusted
      custody records and exploratory analysis, ensuring the core remains verifiable regardless of environment or
      deployment.

      <strong>Focus:</strong> evidence integrity, deterministic systems, provenance, bounded AI support.

      <h3>DendriFlow</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      DendriFlow is a separate passion project exploring how developers can be augmented through a modular DevEx toolkit
      designed to integrate with existing engineering tools and workflows.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is an R&D space for building composable automation tooling that reduced repetitive overhead, support context
      retention, and introduce carefully scoped AI assistance only where it is clearly useful and human-controlled.

      <strong>Focus:</strong> developer experience, modular automation, responsible augmentation.
