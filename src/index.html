                        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> DendriFlow is an advanced automation and orchestration
                            platform
                            inspired by the structure of the human brain. It empowers developers to streamline tasks
                            by
                            connecting modular AI-enhanced components—called <em>Neurons</em>—that mirror cognitive
                            flow
                            and decision-making patterns.</p>
