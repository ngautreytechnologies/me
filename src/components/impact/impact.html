    A few examples of architectural work delivered under real business and operational constraints.

    <h3>Platform Performance and Customer Retention</h3>

    <p><strong>Situation:</strong>
      A legacy rebate calculation engine was struggling to scale for a major customer with significantly increased
      processing demand.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Action:</strong>
      I designed and delivered an interim redesign of the tiered processing flow, improving throughput while a longer-term
      evolution was planned.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong>
      Delivered an ~85% performance improvement and helped secure and retain key customers during a high-stakes scaling period.

    <h3>Scalable Service Boundaries in a Governance Platform</h3>

    <p><strong>Situation:</strong>
      A compliance platform needed to evolve rapidly without accumulating architectural drift or operational coupling.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Action:</strong>
      I introduced clear integration boundaries and modular backend design so new capabilities could be added safely and independently.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong>
      Improved maintainability, extensibility, and operational clarity as the product grew in complexity.

    <h3>Reliability and Observability Without Domain Pollution</h3>

    <p><strong>Situation:</strong>
      As systems became more business-critical, production confidence and diagnosability were essential — without compromising core correctness.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Action:</strong>
      I designed clean interfaces for monitoring and operational tooling so observability could be layered externally without leaking into domain logic.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Result:</strong>
      Improved production visibility and resilience while keeping the core system deterministic and infrastructure-independent.
