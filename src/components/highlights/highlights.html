  <h2>Career Highlights</h2>

  <p class="muted">
    Across 13+ years of production engineering, I have been trusted to lead high-leverage architectural work
    that reduces systemic risk and enables teams to deliver faster with confidence.
  </p>

  <ul class="highlights">
    <li>
      Led major platform re-architecture initiatives, delivering an ~85% performance improvement in critical
      processing workloads and helping secure and retain key customers.
    </li>

    <li>
      Designed scalable backend services with clear integration boundaries, making systems easier to extend,
      operate, and evolve safely as product complexity and customer demands grew.
    </li>

    <li>
      Embedded reliability and observability as first-class architectural concerns, while keeping core domain
      logic clean, deterministic, and independent of infrastructure.
    </li>

    <li>
      Improved defect rates and delivery confidence by strengthening unit testing discipline, clean code practices,
      and pragmatic engineering standards within mature codebases.
    </li>

    <li>
      Supported rapid delivery of key customer-facing milestones by balancing architectural integrity with continuous
      execution under real business timelines.
    </li>

    <li>
      Applied AI selectively to support workflows where it added clear value, while keeping core system behaviour
      deterministic, privacy-conscious, and firmly under human control.
    </li>
  </ul>
