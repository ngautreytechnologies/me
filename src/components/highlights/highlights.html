    Across 13+ years in software engineering, I've delivered end-to-end systems across the stack — scalable backend
    services
    and APIs, modern web interfaces, and production reliability with major performance gains in critical workloads. I’ve
    also set platform direction in compliance-heavy environments and built integrity-focused local-first systems such as
    CaseCell and DendriFlow.

    Below are a few examples of high-impact architectural contributions delivered under real business and operational
    constraints:
  </p>

  <ul class="highlights">
    <li>
      Led major <strong>platform re-architecture</strong> initiatives, delivering an
      <strong>~85% performance improvement</strong> in critical processing workloads and helping
      <strong>secure and retain key customers</strong>.
    </li>

    <li>
      Designed scalable backend services with clear <strong>integration boundaries</strong>,
      making systems easier to extend, operate, and <strong>evolve safely</strong> as product complexity and
      customer demands grew.
    </li>

    <li>
      Embedded <strong>reliability</strong> and <strong>observability</strong> as first-class architectural concerns,
      while keeping core domain logic clean, <strong>deterministic</strong>, and independent of infrastructure.
    </li>

    <li>
      Improved defect rates and delivery confidence by strengthening
      <strong>unit testing discipline</strong>, clean code practices, and pragmatic engineering standards
      within mature codebases.
    </li>

    <li>
      Supported delivery of key customer-facing milestones by balancing
      <strong>architectural integrity</strong> with pragmatic execution under real business timelines.
    </li>

    <li>
      Applied AI selectively where it added value, while keeping core system behaviour
      <strong>deterministic</strong>, privacy-conscious, and firmly under <strong>human control</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>
