    Over 13+ years in software engineering, I've delivered full-stack backend and platform systems across multiple
    domains,
    progressing from hands-on implementation through to principal-level architecture, scalability, and long-term systems
    evolution.

    <p class="role-dates muted">2025 - Present</p>

    <ul class="role-points">
      <li>
        Building <strong>CaseCell</strong>, a local-first evidence and chain-of-custody platform for high-stakes,
        integrity-critical workflows where provenance and admissibility must withstand external scrutiny.
      </li>

      <li>
        Modelled and implemented the core architecture using <strong>Domain-Driven Design</strong>, with explicit
        bounded contexts separating admissible Custody and Derivation layers from non-admissible Sandbox exploration.
      </li>

      <li>
        Delivered deterministic integrity guarantees by construction: canonical artefact identity, provenance capture,
        and tamper-evident custody continuity across evidence lifecycles.
      </li>

      <li>
        Built the Sandbox as a disposable investigative layer (including bounded AI support), with strict admissibility
        enforcement and human-controlled promotion workflows into tribunal-grade derived artefacts.
      </li>

      <li>
        Alongside this, developing <strong>DendriFlow</strong> as a smaller DevEx research project exploring modular
        workflow automation, developer ergonomics, and carefully bounded AI assistance.

    <h3>Principal Software Engineer — Alchem Technologies Ltd</h3>
    <p class="role-dates muted">Mar 2024 - Jul 2025</p>

    <ul class="role-points">
      <li>
        Set architectural direction for a domain-driven modular platform, balancing near-term delivery with a clear
        path to future decomposition.
      </li>

      <li>
        Defined integration boundaries and modelling discipline to reduce coupling and enable safe evolution in a
        compliance-heavy domain.
      </li>

      <li>
        Led proof-of-concept workstreams to validate approach and de-risk innovative platform capabilities.
      </li>

      <li>
        Mentored engineers through design reviews, exploratory delivery, and maintainable architecture practices.

    <ul class="role-points">
      <li>
        Led redesign of a complex tiered rebate calculation engine, delivering an
        <strong>~85% performance improvement</strong> in critical workloads.

      <li>
        Strengthened platform reliability and extensibility while supporting customer-specific commercial flexibility.
