# CV Website — Nicholas Gautrey

This repository contains my personal CV website, built as a lightweight, modular, framework-free system.

It is designed to be:

- fast to load
- easy to maintain
- simple to extend over time
- structured around clear component boundaries

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages and serves as a living, engineer-friendly CV.

## Project Goals

This CV site is intentionally built without heavy frontend frameworks.

- modular system boundaries
- maintainable evolution over time
- simple, deterministic execution

The result is a CV that is both human-readable and architecturally disciplined.
